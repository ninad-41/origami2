                <h3><p> Hi, My name is Ninad Gugle. I have created this website to help beginners in origami.
                    This website is dedicated to my friend, Honey. Honey has an origami studio.
                    She always wanted to show her creativity online. So she decided to make 
                    a website of her own and asked me to help. Here she wishes to explain 
                    step-by-step how origami is made. I hope you all enjoy making the origami.
                </p></h3>
